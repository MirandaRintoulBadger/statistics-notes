[["index.html", "Statistics 371 Full Notes About", " Statistics 371 Full Notes Miranda Rintoul 2024-09-24 About This is a reference document for the material covered in STAT 371. It is a complete collection of my (Miranda’s) personal notes for STAT 371. These notes follow the material in lecture almost exactly, but they are not meant to be read off of or otherwise used during class. They’re much too verbose for that! Instead, I encourage you to use this document as a reference outside of class, as a tool for homework or studying. Important sections are in separate blocks. This is a definition of a new concept or an important property. This is an exercise to practice what was just learned. Exercise solutions are in purple. This is something to ponder on your own. It’s not a class exercise, but it can deepen your knowledge of the material. This indicates a very common mistake or misconception when learning statistics for the first time!
