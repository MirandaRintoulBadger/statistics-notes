# About {-}

**This is a reference document for the material covered in STAT 371.**

It is a complete collection of my (Miranda's) personal notes for STAT 371.  These notes follow the material in lecture almost exactly, but they are *not* meant to be read off of or otherwise used during class.  They're much too verbose for that!

Instead, I encourage you to use this document as a reference outside of class, as a tool for homework or studying.
